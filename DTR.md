# DTR: Define the Relationship

Use this template when conducting DTR with your project partners. *It's recommended that you copy/paste this template into your own gist each time you conduct a DTR to take notes on the conversation.*

### Guiding Questions to Define The Relationship:

* What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
* What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
* How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
* How would you describe your work style?
* What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
* What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
* How will we set direction and make decisions as a team?
* How will we overcome obstacles?
* What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
* What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
* What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?
* What do you identify as being your biggest strength(s) technically, as they relate to this project? Where do you feel you could use improvement in your technical skills, as they relate to this project? How can our team help support you in improving these skills?
* What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
* How do you want the group to solve problems when members run into issues with features of the project?
* How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
* How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?

Any additional questions that you would like to add:

### Remote Work Considerations During the COVID-19 Quarantine
* What does remote focus look like for you? (headphones, distractions minimized (tv, family stuff, etc), video on)
* When working from the same place where you live, life can get in the way. What are some potential life things that could affect your ability to focus, and what plan can we come up with to approach those moments?
* If we encounter issues such as power outages, Zoom difficulties, or bad wifi, what backup plans can we have in place? (This could have answers like  asking a neighbor to borrow wifi, using cellphone hotspot for internet, switching to slack or skype.
* Pomodoro breaks are especially important for remote work and doubly so for quarantine. What should our Pom cadence look like? How will hold ourselves accountable?
* Quarantine is tough, so it’s important to make note of our mental/emotional state when working with others. How can we make space to check in on each other’s well being, in addition to the work that needs to be done?

Project:Battleship

Group Member Names: Alex and Zach T

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
Passing the project is the main priority. Learning how to write ruby following ruby convention and learning how to work collaboratively is super important as well. This will show us we have succeeded.

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
Z - Zach is empathic and therefore can be attentive to his partners needs when working on this project.
A - Alex is also an empath and can easily navigate challenges.

How we can use our strengths to overcome obstacles:

Zach and Alex value finding common ground to deal with productive struggle and motivate each other to succeed.

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have? Make sure to discuss the remote questions above in regards to this section):
A - Meeting Wednesday mornings with mentor. Zach is welcome to join. Alex's dog needs to be played with at random times.
Z - Mornings are better than later into the night. Zach has a tiny human that he would like to interact with.
Weekdays:
mornings 7:30 - 8:30
afternoons 4 -5 then 7-10

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team? How will we communicate about our emotional and mental well-being with each other?):

Keep slack open and exchange phone numbers.

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
Zach has some DIY javascript stuff from the past and would like to experience productive struggle to improve his ruby conventions and syntax.

Alex is a repeater that failed the paired project last time so conditionals and testing are her targeted areas of improvement.

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):
Everything will be worked on together.

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
Driver navigator with switch daily and allow for equal hands on experience.

Pomodoro Break Schedule:
Alex will be the POM time keeper. 40 on 20 off.

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
If there are any issues that arise we agree to be as open and tactfully direct as possible to not let miscommunications fester.

Additional Remote Considerations:

Project management tools we will use (GitHub projects or Trello are popular tools):
Private zoom used to force breaks at the 40 min mark.

Day 1 Agenda: PLAN

Additional Notes: Yay
